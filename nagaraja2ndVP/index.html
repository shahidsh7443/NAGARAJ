        </div>
	<p>As an entrepreneur, Nagaraja is a part of the United Coffee Association of India; the Indian Coffee Trade Association, and the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry.</p>
    <p>He enjoys playing sports, and is an active member of the Karnataka State Rifle Association, India.</p>
    <p>He believes that an integral part of being a leader is giving back to society. He does community service and is part of Shivalli Smartha Brahmana Mahaparishath.</p>
    <p>Nagaraja loves travelling around the world and makes it a point to visit one of the local Toastmasters club whenever possible. He understands that being a leader is a responsibility that involves making a difference. Thus his theme: <span class="highlight">BE THE DIFFERENCE, THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE.</span></p>

    	<h3>Why Nagaraja Rao</h3>
    	<img src="img/why.png" class="pull-left visible-xs">
    	<p class="mar-top-s">As District Governor of India and Sri Lanka, Nagaraja oversaw one of the most diverse districts in all of Toastmasters. He has faced and overcome a multitude of challenges that most District Governors never face. India is the third largest country in Asia and the seventh largest in the world, and has a population in excess of 1.2 billion people, with 22 official languages and more than 2000 dialects. His district was the epitome of diversity. The amount of travel and dedication needed to cover such a large area, for training and contests, would test any leader. Nagaraja not only succeeded in doing this, but excelled - ending his LGET and District Governor years as Number one in the world!</p>
        <p>Nagaraja is defined by his passion for Servant Leadership. He firmly believes in the Toastmasters tagline Where Leaders Are Made. He has seen how Toastmasters has transformed him into a leader in his business and community.  He is now keen to enable others to use this program to make a difference to themselves and others. He is eager to demonstrate his belief that we all can <span class="highlight">'BE THE DIFFERENCE, THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE'.</span></p>
        <p>As an International Officer, he would bring his experience of 30 years in International business and 15 years in Toastmasters leadership to bear on issues such as strategizing, policymaking, financial oversight, planning and marketing. His cumulative knowledge from living and working in such a diverse area of the world would help him serve the organisation well as it expands in a dynamic market.</p>

    	<p><span class="sprite quote"></span>Nagaraja Rao is an  action-oriented leader who puts emphasis on value-driven leadership. Not only has he been instrumental in growing the Toastmaster movement in District 82, he has also been a mentor to many aspiring leaders and speakers, including me. A quality that stands out in Nagaraja is his unflinching integrity and his unfailing kindness. These two qualities allows him to empathize with and relate to people while driving for results in a very transparent and ethical manner. He has most certainly earned my vote of confidence as a reliable and consistent leader who epitomizes the values of Toastmasters International. <span class="sprite quote close-quote"></span></p>

        <p>Right from the beginning of the year, Nagaraja provided the knowledge and insights required to make our district successful. He offered real, practical solutions to issues that the fledgling district was facing. Most importantly, he inspired and motivated our district membership to excellence. In the very first year of operation, District 93 was awarded President's Distinguished District under his guidance. When I met him during Mid-Year Training, he offered sage advice about leadership that I was able to apply not only in Toastmasters but also in my personal life. He was the difference that made a difference in our district.<span class="sprite quote close-quote"></span></p>

He was very prudent in managing the district funds and yet would release all approved claims, well in time. I wish him all the best<span class="sprite quote close-quote"></span></p>

I had the good fortune of joining Toastmasters and meeting Nagaraja Rao. Having started as an ordinary member, I today stand transformed as a confident leader, thanks to his constant support, encouragement and guidance.

        <p>I've known Nagaraja since 2009, and I've paid particular attention to how he relates with his team members, and how much respect they had for him. Sitting to an in-depth interview on leadership with Nagaraja revealed what I intuitively sensed about him; he is a passionate leader who leads casting a strong vision and empowering his leaders to achieve the vision. His answers to a lot of my questions, and the stories he told about his experiences outside Toastmasters revealed a person who thinks outside the box and is open to exploring unconventional solutions to problems faced by his team.</p>
        <p>Nagaraja understands the challenges of leading a diverse team, conducting business across cultures, and has wrestled with implementing board decisions at the local level.
