        <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>We respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through our compliance with this website privacy policy.

This Policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit this website and our practices for collecting, using, protecting and disclosing that information. By visiting this domain, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy.</p>

	<li>On our website</li>
    <li>In e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and our website</li>
    <li>Through mobile and desktop applications you download from our website, which provide dedicated non-browser-based interaction between you and our website</li>
    <li>When you interact with our advertising and applications on third-party websites and services, if those applications or advertising include links to this Policy</li>
</ul>

    <li>Your responses to surveys that we might ask you to complete for research purposes.</li>
    <li>There may be features that are developed in the future that may result in the collection of additional new information. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Information we collect and how we collect it: </h4>
<p>We collect several types of information from and about users of our website, including information:</p>
<p>By which you may be personally identified, including your name, email address</p>
<p>We collect this information:</p>
<p>Directly from you when you provide it to us.</p>
<p>Automatically as you navigate through the website. Information collected automatically may include usage details, Information Protocol (IP) addresses and information collected through cookies, and other tracking technologies.</p>
<p>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use "cookies," and we obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses this website. </p>

<p>Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our website, including date and time (how you arrived, navigated through and exited Toastmasters.org); cookie number; products you viewed. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript, to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page. This information is collected in the interest of making the website work better for you.</p>

<p>A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission provides useful information about online privacy on its own website, http://www.privacy.ca.gov/.  </p>

<p>Information from Other Sources: Third party advertisers may appear on our website from time to time. They may be able to detect that visitors to their website arrived via this website. However, we do not receive any information from these or other outside websites regarding your page views, purchases or any other information.</p>

<h4>What about cookies?</h4>
<p>Cookies are tiny bits of information that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as your personalized profile.</p>
<p>The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of the most entertaining and helpful features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>

<h4>How do we use your information?</h4>
<p>We use information that we collect about you or that you provide to us, including any personal information:</p>
<ul>
	<li>To present our website and its contents to you.</li>
    <li>To offer and fulfill our core business purposes.</li>
    <li>To fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it.</li>
    <li>To carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.</li>
    <li>To notify you about changes to our website or any products or services we offer or provide.</li>
    <li>To allow you to participate in interactive features on our website.</li>
    <li>In any other way we may describe when you provide the information.</li>
    <li>For any other purpose with your consent.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Do we share the information we receive?</h4>
<p>Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. </p>

<h4>How secure is my information?</h4>
<p>This website is committed to protecting the security of your personal information and maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that meet industry standards to guard your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. We protect your account information by placing it on the secure portion of our website, using firewalls and other security technology to protect our network and systems from external attacks, and requiring you to enter a unique user name and password to access your account information online.
When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption. We use industry-standard (SSL) technology to prevent unauthorized parties from viewing potentially sensitive information such as your name and address, as well as critically sensitive information like your credit card number, that you provide or access during a secure session (look for a padlock or key and chain icon on your browser).</p>
<p>The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Passwords, registered with our website, are encrypted to ensure protection against unauthorized access to your personal information. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of our website. The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of our website. It is important for you to guard against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. </p>

<h4>What about third-party advertisers and links to other websites?</h4>
<p>Our site may include third-party advertising and links to other websites. We do not provide any personally identifiable customer information to these advertisers or third-party websites. The rest of this section offers some examples as well as information on how to opt-out of their information collection practices.</p>
<p>Examples of third-party advertisers and advertising companies that serve advertising content directly to your browser on certain of the pages may include Atlas and Doubleclick. You can find out more about their information collection and use practices, including how to opt out of cookies and other collection techniques that they use, by clicking on the links to their websites in this paragraph.</p>
<p>These third-party websites and advertisers, or Internet advertising companies working on their behalf, sometimes use technology to send (or "serve") the advertisements that appear on our website directly to your browser. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (also known as action tags or single-pixel gifs), and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features that they may use, and the information practices of these advertisers and third-party websites are not covered by this Privacy Policy. Please contact them directly for more information about their privacy practices. In addition, the Network Advertising Initiative offers useful information about Internet advertising companies (also called "ad networks" or "network advertisers"), including information about how to opt-out of their information collection.</p>
<h4>Which information can I access?</h4>
<p>This website gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with Toastmasters International for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. Examples of data you can access at Toastmasters.org include your order history and personally identifiable information (including name, email, password, and your club membership history). This list will change and expand as our website evolves.</p>
<h4>What are my options for providing information?</h4>
<p>You can always choose not to provide information, although it is needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such Toastmasters.org features as your personal profile. Consequently, if you choose not to provide information on this website, you will be unable to conduct transactions with Toastmasters International using the Internet. Alternatives for making purchases or updating your Toastmasters International records may involve using the postal or a courier service, calling Toastmasters International’s Member Services Department or visiting the store at World Headquarters in California.</p>
<p>You can add or update certain information on pages such as your Profile. When you update information, we may keep a copy of the prior version for our records.</p>
<h4>Changes to our Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>Our website is growing, and our Privacy Notice and the Conditions of Use will change also. We may email periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, though you should still check our website frequently to see reports on the latest changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account.</p>
<p>This website may change, add, modify or remove portions of this Policy at any time, which shall become effective immediately upon posting on this page. The date the Policy was last revised is identified at the bottom of the page. It is your responsibility to review this Policy for any changes. By continuing to use our website, you agree to any changes in the Policy.</p>
