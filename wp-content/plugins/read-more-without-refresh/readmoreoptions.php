Heyo! Thanks for using our plugin - Its a pleasure.
<br><br>
<b>Read More without Refresh</b> is a WordPress plugin that allows you include text which wont be visible to users, unless they press "Read More" button.
<br>Its purpose is to <b>boost your SEO</b> and your visitors experience, by <b>allowing you to include tons of data readable by search engines, without affecting your visitors in a negative way</b>.<br><br><br>
In case you are not aware of its usage, simply paste this shortcode within your posts/pages, and include hidden text between the closing:
<br><br>
<span style="font-size:16px;background-color:#fff;padding: 5px;">[read more="<span style="color:#d67575;">Click here to Read More</span>" less="<span style="color:#d67575;">Read Less</span>"]<span style="color:#000;"><b> My Hidden Paragraph Here </b></span>[/read]</span>
<br><br>
You can alter "<b>Click here to Read More</b>" and "<b>Read Less</b>" texts by editing <b>/wp-content/plugins/read-more-without-refresh/index.php</b> file.
<br>
You can alter colors by editing <b>/wp-content/plugins/read-more-without-refresh/style.css</b> file.
